> **Connecting Street Vendors with Trusted Raw Material Suppliers**  
> A smart, scalable, and inclusive platform built during [Hackathon Name].

## 🚀 Overview

Street food vendors form the backbone of our local economy, but sourcing quality raw materials remains a challenge — unreliable suppliers, high costs, and lack of access to wholesale networks.

**RawEase** bridges this gap with a digital supply chain platform where:
- 🛒 **Vendors** can order verified raw materials easily.
- 📦 **Suppliers** can list their stock and reach more customers.
- 📊 Smart dashboards, recommendations, and order tracking are built-in.
